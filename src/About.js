          <strong>About Pomodoro Technique üçé</strong>
          <br />
          Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco
          Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into
          intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
          Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for
          tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a
          university student. Pomodoro technique increases productivity by
          taking short scheduled breaks regularly.

          <strong>How to use Pomodoro timer</strong>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>Decide on the task to be done </li>
            <li>Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes)</li>
            <li>Work on the task </li>
            <li>
              End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically
              5‚Äì10 minutes)
            </li>
            <li>
              Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodoros.
            </li>
            <li>
              After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (typically 20 to
              30 minutes) instead of a short break.
              <br />
              Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
